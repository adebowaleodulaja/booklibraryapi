# Book Library Management System

## Running the program

Download the repo, make sure to have a minimum of Java 8. Run the file `BooklibraryApplication.java`. It will run on port 8000
by default, this can be updated in the `application.properties` file.

## Deleting a Category

You need to make sure the category is not linked to a book already - if that's the case, the book has to be deleted first before the category can be deleted.
